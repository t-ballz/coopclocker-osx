Ok, so this Jekyll thing on this Github thing seems to be working. Not bad. Let's get this blogging thing rolling then. I'll figure it out as I go.

## So, what's the deal here? ##

So the story is that even though I've been a developer for 5 years, I've never really done a personal project on my own that hasn't collapsed into itself after the initial enthusiasm has passed. You know, the sort when you go _Oh oh this is so cool I totally want to do this, let me get my coding tools and prove myself that I can change my life..._ and then after a few tries and a few stuffs got done, your attention span sort of runs out of sugar and goes limp and you just go back to doing your usual boring shit (or whatever it is that you do). And in your free time you keep floating aimlessly until you get another one of these hypes and the cycle repeats.

So, lately I've been in some life situations that made me realize that I'm really terrible at keeping myself on track, let alone keep a bunch of other people on track. As a result I figured out I need to focus on...focusing better. And by this I mean self-management rather than single-mindedness. So I read-up on stuff like personal kanban and other productivity and management tools and started writing down more and more of my shit with the intent of getting said shit organized and maybe done someday. I even got myself a whiteboard for home (yes, I did draw penises on it)(no, it was not a part of personal kanban).
Meanwhile, everyone else at work realized the very same thing I just said and to take matters into our own hands, we started using some extra task-management tools and productivity techniques. So I had this idea of making our own time-tracking app, which synchronizes runs for the whole team and lets our statuses be visible on our live dashboard. And...that was the basic idea, yeah. A multi-player task-keeping countdown-based productivity-tool. A little brainstorming, and it all seemed like a good idea to throw it open-source, give it a name and try to do it properly as a hobby-project. CoopClocker.

So, yeah, I've decided to let this one hype take a little farther off than the rest. Maybe grow itself into a journey where I can figure out how to actually keep myself on track, probably learn how to use proper productivity tools and learn a thing or two about application design and some new technologies. All this while...creating a productivity tool myself. Hey, does anyone else notice a pattern here?
