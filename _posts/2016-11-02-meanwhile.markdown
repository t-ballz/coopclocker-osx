## And then time passed... ##

There was this fun little project here that I began coding, and then I got a full-time project again.
And then another.  
And I had some breather, which I used to do other things (set up a FreeNAS NAS), but then got another full-time project.  
And so on.  

Until it seems that a full year has passed.  
And then this project here, I haven't touched it ever since.
For a while I kept remembering to continue, but then slowly other things flooded my (already chaotic) TODO list, and this here sort of just fell out.  
And then my Macbook died and needs to be replaced (I'm on Linux for the time being).

And, basically, that's how it is at the moment.

Sorry, CoopClocker, life hasn't been too kind to you.  
I really don't want to make any promises when it will.
