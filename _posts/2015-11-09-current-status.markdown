## Blog, Kanban ##

So, I've just began this blog here. It still needs proper styling and I'll still need to figure out some more tricks with it, and I'll probably shuffle things around a bit before I'm happy with it, but whatever. Let's just keep the ball rolling for now.

Oh yeah, there's a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/npBsYREo/plans-and-progresses) going on, feel free to...check it out and recommend the shit out of this whole thing.

`TODO:`  
Figure out styling for blog, organize generic personal stuff and project-related stuff (maybe split blogs?)

## App ##

Before I made the first commit to Github here, I already had ideas about its basic functionality, basic technologies and code-architecture (OSX 10.10+, Swift 1.2, MVVM + Rx) a basic sketch of the app's main interface on paper, and a basic UI implementation of said interface. Nothing big, just a few classes with their ViewModels and their bindings.

Rx and FRP is cool, really. OSX is pretty weird after iOS.

And basically, this is where I'm at at the moment. I still keep brainstorming a lot and getting some wild ideas here and there about where this whole tool could grow.

What I need to decide on at the moment is a minimal feature-set, then keep focusing on getting that feature-set working. Like, you know, actually getting stuff done while working towards an actual, attainable goal.

So, let's say that the first "milestone" should be an app that can: add a task (with proper meta-info), count-down track it, notify when it runs out, keep a list of tasks done.

`TODO:`  
Design add-task popup, design end-notification popup, implement add-task popup, implement end-notification popup, code task-keeping models, code task-keeping and countdown logic.
