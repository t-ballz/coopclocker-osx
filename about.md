CoopClocker is a team-oriented countdown-based time-tracking tool.

It's a small personal project I've started to create a tool for myself and my friends to use. I plan to keep adding to it as I go.

This is the first phase of the project: a small OSX status-bar app, where I can learn about OSX development and test-drive the idea.
